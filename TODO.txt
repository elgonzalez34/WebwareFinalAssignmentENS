TODO

-Add some sort of template that represent a generic blog post

-When submit button is pressed the html from the blog editor box is uploaded into a new Bootstrap panel without the page reloading

-Add a link or button or something that says "create blog post". When you click it a blog editor box pops up

-Add functionality for multiple pages that change by pressing the tabs at the top

-Probably want to make JSON objects instead of writing to a text file for storing the blog posts-> text file was just to lay the groundwork

-Move script code in index.html into scripts.js -> scripts.js already is being served, I just couldn't get it to work with the text editor stuff, probably need to include stuff or something

-Beautify the css

-Maybe more I'm not sure?



-OPTIONAL-

-Add a button that allows you to change the header image

-Allow users to customize the colors

-Support user names and different accounts, as opposed to being editable by anyone
