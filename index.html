    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> For our project we will create the infrastructure for a blogging site, which will allow bloggers to create and customize their own blog. When viewing their site, the admin would have certain special permissions. Examples of these would be the ability to make posts, customize the banner above their site, create navigation tabs, add links of interests easily accessible to regular users, change the color scheme, and so on. Regular users would be limited to browsing, navigating, and leaving comments on the posts that they like. Additionally, users would be able to upvote posts that they find interesting, or downvote others. Our web application would store all of these blog posts and comments. Our design would be modular, so that additional features could easily be added to the infrastructure in the future. </p>
