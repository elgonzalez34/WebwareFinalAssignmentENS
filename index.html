    <h2>Summary</h1>
    <p> For our project we will create the infrastructure for a blogging site, which will allow bloggers to create and customize their own blogging site. When viewing the site, the admin would have certain special permissions, such as being able to make posts, customizing the banner at the top of the site, create navigation tabs, add links to the right side of the page, change the color scheme, and so on. Regular users would be able to browse, navigate, and leave comments on the site. Additionally, users could upvote certain posts they like, or downvote others. Our web application would store all of this information on blog posts and comments. Our design would be modular, so that additional features could easily be added to the infrastructure in the future. </p>
